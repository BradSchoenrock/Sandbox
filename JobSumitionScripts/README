***********************************


start by runing 

bash setupJobSumition.sh

this sets up directories SubmitError, SubmitLog, and SubmitOutput which is where 
output files will be stored 

then edit GenerateSubmit.sh in the following ways
1)adjust the path names to the directory you want
2)adjust source2 to be the script you want to run
3)adjust n to be the number of jobs you want to submit
4)adjust count to be the number of jobs you want to submit

note: if you are not starting at 1 in these two loops then all submit commands written 
to MainSubmit.sh will be appended to the end of the file rather than creating a new file

the result of running 

bash GenerateSubmit.sh 

will be the following

it creates MainSubmit.sh
it creates a series of SubMainSubmit###.sh and SubMainSubmit###.submit scripts that 
aid in the job submition in the SubMainSubmit directory

then to submit jobs run 

bash MainSubmit.sh

the output directories were set up by running setupJobSubmition.sh earlier



********************
once your jobs are submited you can run 

condor_q

or 

condor_q yourUserName

to see the jobs currently in the queue

or if things have started to go awry you can do 

condor_rm "processNumber"

to remove the job from condor

**********************

a note on concurrency limits

#ConcLim="Concurrency_Limits = DISK_T3WORK5:40"

#echo "${ConcLim}" >> /home/schoenr1/work/Madgraph/SubMainSubmit/SubMainSubmit$1.submit

uncomment these lines and change T3WORK5 to the disk you are working on to avoid 
overloading one disk with many jobs that are reading in or writing to the same disk.
