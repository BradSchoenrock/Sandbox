After policykit has been fixed

If Policykit is already fix on a stitcher and you seeing the logevents file grow to over 134 meg do the following command. (polkit service must be running)

systemctl stop collector;systemctl stop kestrel;sleep 3;systemctl start kestrel;systemctl start collector

This will allow the logevents file to process.
