Hi Brad,

 

Can you please try this out with your username:

 

On your local terminal:

ssh -N -f -L localhost:8889:localhost:8889 98.8.163.106

 

On your local browser:

http://localhost:8889

 

If it works, it should ask for a token. Did it?

 

The token is:

5673bbbe8298814ef383e2d248dbb27285224fabe5dd155a

 

You should then see Alex-test.ipynb, try to open and run it
