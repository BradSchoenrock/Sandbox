Lets start with a summary of outages while i was on call 
---------
twctx - CSM config not loaded
madison and stevens point - AMS EPG data not updating, log levels set to DEBUG
dldctx - CSM03 lost connection to stitchers
lincoln - TSB failover to misconfigured secondary, incorrect bitrate for multicast
inland empire - CMTS wasn't pointed at TSB multicast & then TSB multicast was improperly set up (wrong pid & pid bitrate). This shouldn't have had an effect on legacy systems but was.
