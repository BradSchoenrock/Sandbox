Plans for this week

develop data structures to hold session data in a sensible way.

provide insights for session data.  
continue discussions with Shamil and Sakshi on Mind Control architecture.

look into Kafka for data streaming, I'm hoping to integrate our data collection methods for ML into Mind Control's communication infrastructure.
